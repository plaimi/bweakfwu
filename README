About bweakfwu
===============
bweakfwu is a crossover between Pong and Breakout with retro (shit) graphics. 
It features local two-player.

The controls are up/down arrow for moving the right paddle, and left arrow for
launching its ball. For the right paddle, use 'u'/'j' for moving the paddle,
and 'k' for launching the ball. Space pauses the game. We do not have control
remapping support yet, but you can change it in src/bweakfwu/Handle.hs.

For a more detailed explanation of features see the design document in 
doc/design.txt. For an explanation of how these features are implemented see 
the Haddock-generated documentation.


Dependencies
============

The only library that is required is gloss >= 1.8.0.

The game is built using ghc.
