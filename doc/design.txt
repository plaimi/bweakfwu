Overview
========

The game has a menu and a game world.


Menu system
===========

The menu system consists of two menus:
    - Main menu
    - Options

Main menu
---------
The main menu has three buttons:
    - New game (makes a new Game World)
    - Options (opens the Options menu)
    - Quit game (quits the game)

Options
-------
The options menu has two buttons:
    - Change keys (lets the user set the key bindings)
    - Back to main menu (returns to the main menu)

Sound effects
-------------
When the mouse is hovering over an option, a pleasant humming noise is played.

When an option is selected a blip is played.

Else, an annoying high-pitched noise is played.


Game World
==========

The game world consists of:
    -A board with 15*7 bricks.
    -Two paddles, one on each short-end (left and right, respective to the
        screen). Each paddle owns a ball.
    -An on-screen-display

Actors
------
Actors control paddles and get points for their gameplay.

Boards
------
A board is where the game is played. It is a grid of 80 x 45 cells. The game 
has one board, with 15*7 bricks, centred on the screen. Empty board cells are
black.

Bricks
------
Bricks are destructible 1 x 3 cell pieces on the board. The actors are awarded 
one point each time they hit a brick with their ball. Bricks take on the
colour of the ball that hits them. They lose hit points when a ball of the
same colour hits them.

Paddles
-------
Paddles are the "characters" of the game. They may move vertically (respective 
to the screen). A paddle is 1 x 5 cells. The left paddle is yellow and the 
right is magenta.

Ball
----
A ball is a small round object that may collide with the edges of the screen, 
paddles and bricks. A ball is a cell. The ball shares its colour with its 
owner paddle. Each paddle owns a ball.

Rules
-----
The object of the game is to hit the bricks on the board and then to make the 
balls hit the screen edge behind the opponent actor's paddle.

Hitting a brick makes it owned by the player that hits it. The brick gradually
takes on the colour of the player that hit it, and eventually shatters when it
becomes completely solid.

If a paddle's ball hits the opponent paddle's screen edge, the paddle's actor 
gets 50 points.

If a paddle's ball hits the paddle's screen edge, the paddle's actor gets -30
points.

On-screen-display
-----------------
The on-screen display shows the current score centred at the top of the board.

Sound effects
-------------
When the ball collides with something, a goat scream is played.

Music
-----
The game has stressful and angst-infused background music.
